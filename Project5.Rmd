  ## This function takes vectors of starting populations by one year age class,  
  ## instantaneous per capita death rates per year, and number of deaths in the 
  ## j-th week as inputs. Notice that the number of deaths is not sex specific.
  ## It iterates the model forward for length(d) weeks, and returns the 
  ## predicted number of deaths each week as a vector.
